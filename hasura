This file is to be automatically replaced by Hasura CLI binary file by postinstall lifecycle hooks.

The replacement only has to be processed when a client installs hasura-cli package.

When publishing the package, this file should be dummy file like as it is now.

So, on development, do not commit change on this file to Hasura CLI binary.
